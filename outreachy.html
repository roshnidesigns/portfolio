        The project is about redesigning the interface of InterMine Org, an open-source community focussed on integrating/operating biological data sources. As an Outreachy intern, I collaborated with the InterMine community to improve the usability and overall experience of this new platform for its launch - later the year.

        2.&emsp;The what and why?
      </h1>
      <div class="padding40"></div>
  
      <p class="body">
        Now, InterMine is a very broad term also defined as a system ‚Äúintegrating biological data sources around the world, making it easy to query and analyze data‚Äú plus it is open-source! In short, there are many InterMines worldwide- covering a broad range of organisms and life science research areas, through the help of which several data analysts, biologists, pharmacists, and scientists carry out their day-to-day operations. 
      </p><div class="padding10"></div><p class="body">
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  Until now, there were individual organism-specific InterMines present, meaning no single interface integrating them all into one and so making it hard to enter different mines and operating at them individually, here enters BlueGenes üöÄ
      </p>
      <div class="padding40"></div>

      <h3 class="heading">
        Main objective is-
      </h3><div class="padding20"></div>
  
      <p class="body">
        Creating BlueGenes aimed to provide an interface, a platform, and a medium through which open-source scientific data could be accessed and could be operated and analyzed and upon.
      </p><div class="padding10"></div><p class="body">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
        And so, my work here was to redesign this interface to make it optimal for its users by performing heuristic analysis, collecting insights by conducting remote user testing, and defining challenges simultaneously while collaborating with the InterMine community as well.

      3.&emsp;The Redesign Process
    </h1><div class="padding40"></div>

    <p class="body">
      For the fact I know, there is no linear design process that can ever be ‚Äúfollowed‚Äù and is always full of surprising turns and design decisions that one has to confront along the process. As for me, I tried to define my workflow below.

      Some key insights I found were-    
    </h3><div class="padding20"></div>

    <p class="body">
      That the integrated biological data sources like InterMines are used often for day-to-day purposes. Kicking off- I made a list of our target users and after some research, I jot down a few yet worth mentioning points concerning our users:
    </p><div class="padding10"></div>

    <ul class="body">
      <li>
        Our target users were the organizations, firms, and individuals dealing with biological data sources at any level such as scientists, pharmacists, biologists, students, etcetera.
      </li>
      <li>
        Designing for ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù people is not the same as designing for the b2c sector is. These people are used to component-filled busy screens and simplifying it doesn‚Äôt solve. Before coming to any design decision one has to dive deeper into research.
      </li>
      <li>
        One should keep several things in mind, apparently smooth is easy for them so there is no need for baby-spooning these people as they are used to intake more at once.

      <b class="bold">STARTING WITH QUESTIONS</b><br>
      I started by assigning myself a couple of questions to get me better align our user‚Äôs task and goals:
    </p><div class="padding10"></div>

    <ol class="body">
      <li>
        How do we validate our research findings and assumptions to gain upper hand on actual pain points faced by the users?
      </li>
      <li>
        How do we know what type of users need what kind of services and which guidance level? 
      </li>
      <li>
        How will we drive the users to the most essential parts of the new system and how different is it?
      </li>
      <li>
        How might we provide them a tailored experience for first-time users and habitual ones?

      Internal feedback!

    <p class="body">
      After going through the questions with the team, I got more insights into our user‚Äôs demands and how they get the InterMine system‚Äôs vision. The purpose of this was to discover potential quick wins on simple improvements that could be executed quickly. As for the other questions, we also agreed on conducting User Testings once elementary issues are resolved, to get a better hold of the current situation.
    </p><div class="padding10"></div><p class="body">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
      Before interacting with our users and conducting tests, I decided on revamping the homepage for the fundamentals. This involved diving into similar products like Uniprot, NCBI, Ensemble, etc including articles, and I came up with the following draft-

        I had the prototype ready and working and it was time to get ready with the script for the user testing, pre-test interaction, and post-test feedback too. To get to know users beforehand and to make them at ease, I sent an invitation email asking them for their background and work-related details.

        First things first, I started by persona creation i.e listing the types of user and categorizing according to their profile and behavior, and demographics.
